Mark T. Brandon, Yale University, Michael T. Hren, University of Connecticut

This work is provided as support for a paper by Hren and Brandon (2025) that investigates the relationship of orographic lifting in the US Cordillera to the precipitation produced by that lifting.

The upload of content is pending as of July 21, 2025, and is expected to be completed within the next week.
